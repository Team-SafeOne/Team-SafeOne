PRODUCT TRACING SYSTEM
Acknowledgements
We collaborated with our partners at Precise Software Solutions to work as part of Capstone during our term at George Mason University we got a chance to learn from the best special mention to Zac, Bohan, and Hang for their valuable suggestions,remarks during this period by meeting with us weekly and finally we are grateful for Prof. Robert Kraig who made all these possible.

Problem Scope
About 48 million people in the U.S. (1 in 6) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases to handle this issue the need for FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act) which mainly states the need to maintain records for foods listed on FTL(Food Traceability List) to maintain KDE(Key Data Elements) for specific CTE(Critical Tracking Events) and provide information to the FDA within 24 hours or the timeline to which the FDA has agreed.

The need for traceability has increased in recent years predominantly focussed on consumed products to track the origin of creation. Establishing a well-organized traceability system helps manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers, and law-enforcing departments to keep track of the movement of the products, identify outbreaks, and conduct recalls or withdraw if necessary.

Problem Statement
Our project aims in achieving to key components of the first generating data to develop a tracing system that can scale infinitely to handle multiple supply chains without fail. Secondly, once the traceability is done identifying the contamination accurately helps the law-enforcing departments like FDA(Food and Drug Administration) for decision-making and leveraging ML(Machine Learning) to complete the supply chain network.

Solution
To generate data you need a platform to make the automation for which we have chosen the KNIME Analytics Platform in which we have developed different workflows by using node repositories available and implemented these workflows for all the CTE and generated 10,000 KDE for each CTE by including all the food products in the FTL. As there is a relation between each CTE we used the Neo4j graph database to map them.
